# RoDeO
RoDeo (Robust Design Optimization Package) is a package for simulation based global design optimization. It is specifically designed
for scientific/engineering applications, in which the objective function and constraints are evaluated by computationally expensive simulations. 

Features of the RoDeO Package:
- Surrogate model based Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) strategy
- Data driven approach
- Easy and efficient treatment of inequality constraints
- Surrogate models can be trained also using sensitivity data
