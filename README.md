# RoDeO
RoDeo (Robust Design Optimization Package) is a package for simulation based global design optimization. It is specifically designed
for scientific/engineering applications, in which the objective function and constraints are evaluated by computationally expensive simulations. 

Features of the RoDeO Package:
- Surrogate model based Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) strategy
- Data driven approach
- Easy and efficient treatment of inequality constraints
- Surrogate models can be trained also using sensitivity data

The first version is developed by Dr. Emre Özkaya (SciComp, TU Kaiserslautern)

The current version is developed by Dr. Kai Cheng (SDU) from 2021.09.15-2023.09.14, sponsored by Austrian Research Promotion Agency（FFG）
Under the project: InduHeat-Process and energy optimization using induction for curing the corrosion protection layer in the automotive industry
